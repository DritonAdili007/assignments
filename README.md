This is the README file for my project and assignment

in this github repository i have both the project and the assignments, to run the website you have to download all the files and put them in one folder except for the 3 folders named "adapterAssingment", "builderAssignment" and "commandAssignment". after you put all these files in one folder, simply double click on the "index.html" file and it will run

these three folders are the assignments and they are coded in Swift programming language, to run the assignments it is recomended to use xcode. if you have xCode installed then double click on the ".xcodeproj" files and it will open the entire project and then run the "main.swift" to run the assignments.
